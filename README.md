# GECK
Mixed software/hardware project to create a Garden of Eden Creation Kit. I.e. post-apocalyptic survival laptop


# Initial notes
This project is inspired by a number of places - one is the Fallout game franchise, in which there's a device called G.E.C.K., or Garden of Eden Creation Kit. It is the MacGuggin of the second game in the franchise, and according to the ingame description "_The kit included seed and soil supplements, a fusion power generator (referred to as cold fusion in briefing materials), matter-energy replicators, atmospheric chemical stabilizers and water purifiers._". Further in the description it is mentioned that the device contained large quantities of survival information, encyclopedias and all other data that could be vital for rebuilding society after a catastrofic event.
Another source of inspiration are a few actual similar devices, built by enthusiasts: The Division themed "SHD Cyberdeck" - https://youtu.be/JvbIEimqd0Y; Jay Doscher's "Off Grid Cyberdeck" - https://back7.co/home/raspberry-pi-recovery-kit, and Evan Meaney's "Crash Recovery Device" - https://evanmeaney.com/_recpi.html
