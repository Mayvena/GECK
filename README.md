# GECK
Mixed software/hardware project to create a Garden of Eden Creation Kit. I.e. post-apocalyptic survival laptop


# Initial notes
This project is inspired by a number of places - one is the Fallout game franchise, in which there's a device called G.E.C.K., or Garden of Eden Creation Kit. It is the MacGuggin of the second game in the franchise, and according to the ingame description "__The kit included seed and soil supplements, a fusion power generator (referred to as cold fusion in briefing materials), matter-energy replicators, atmospheric chemical stabilizers and water purifiers.__"
